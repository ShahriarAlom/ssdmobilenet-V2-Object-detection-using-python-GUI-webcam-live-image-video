## About
Welcome to the Object Detection GUI application, developed by MD Shahariar Alom.
This application allows you to perform object detection using a pre-trained TensorFlow
or custom-trained model in a user-friendly graphical interface.

# Features
Choose the TensorFlow model for object detection.
Select the detection source: Image, Video, or Webcam.
Adjust detection parameters such as threshold.
Visualize detection results with bounding boxes and labels.

# Requirements
Python 3.x (I have used 3.10)
TensorFlow 2.13.0 (any 2.x should work)
OpenCV (I have used 4.9)
Tkinter (for GUI)

# Installation
Select your env and run the script by
python <script_name>.py


Choose the TensorFlow SavedModel location for object detection.
Select any one of the detection sources (Image, Video, or Webcam).
Adjust detection parameters as needed in the code like labelmap.pbtxt and
detection threshold.

Click the "Run Detection" button to start object detection.
Visualize detection results in the GUI window.

# Notes
Optional Features: Adjustment of detection parameters is optional and can be customized according to user preferences.
Model Requirements: TensorFlow SavedModel format is required for object detection. Ensure that the selected model is compatible with the application.
Image Labelmap: Optionally, provide a label map file for better visualization of detected objects in images.
Environment: The application was developed and tested using TensorFlow 2.13.0 in a Conda environment on Ubuntu.
